# Introduction

Temci is a web app that let's you schedule Ethereum Transactions to be executed at a later time, in a decentralized and trustless way. It uses the [Ethereum Alarm Clock](https://www.ethereum-alarm-clock.com) project and is entirely written in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org).

ðŸš¨ This is being done for demonstration/learning purposes, use at your own risk ðŸš¨ 

## Live demo
You can try a live demo of the app here: https://natewave.github.io/temci/

(you can also see gifs of the app in action [here](screens/walkthrough.md))

## Run on your own

Clone the repository

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:natewave/temci.git
```

Install deps

```bash
temci> yarn install
```

Run in dev mode

```bash
temci> yarn run
```

The app should be available at `localhost:3000`

To compile an optimized version, run:
```bash
temci> yarn release
```

## Testing
You can use the Kovan test network in [Metamask](https://metamask.io) to test out the app.
